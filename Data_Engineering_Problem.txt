DATA ENGINEERING PROBLEM:

Inner Join : length of resulting array = 6 , Total_Orders(Barry and Steve) = 4

Left Outer Join : length of resulting array = 7 , Total_Orders(Barry and Steve) = 4

Right Outer Join : length of resulting array = 7 , Total_Orders(Barry and Steve) = 4

Full Outer Join : length of resulting array =  8, Total_Orders(Barry and Steve) = 4
